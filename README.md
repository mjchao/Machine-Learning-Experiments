# Machine-Learning-Experiments

Just tinkering around with Machine Learning algorithms. This summer, I'd like to try something with somewhat less-predictable results than what I'm used to programming.

##Directory: Linear Regression
Experiments with attempting to approximate data with linear relationships. This directory deals with single variable linear regression. We produce data from some given linear relationship, y = theta_0 + theta_1 * x, add some noise to it, and apply gradient descent to try and reproduce that data.

###Directory: Linear Regression/Adaptive Learning Rate 
This directory applies single variable gradient descent, but attempt to change the learning rate to make the gradient descent process go faster.

###Directory: Linear Regression/multivariate
